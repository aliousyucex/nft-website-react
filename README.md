# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project, which I have written, is a reimplementation of the nftwebsite[link] project using Vite + React + TypeScript from scratch. Some parts have been excluded as they were not being utilized.

I am aware that such a complex system is not necessary for such a small project. However, I wanted to write this website as organized and separated as possible. While doing this, I aimed to use libraries and frameworks that I feel comfortable with.

Currently, this site is not actively in use. It is also not in a finished state. It is a hobby repository that I continue to work on whenever I have time.

The nftwebsite repository, on the other hand, was a project I started before I began learning programming. When I started this repository, my knowledge was limited to HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.
